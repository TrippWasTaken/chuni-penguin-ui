Artemis frontend with an Aime switching ability because my lazy butt doesnt want to keep changing the text file manually

## Todo
- Everything rn lol

- if you really want to run this be sure to use your local artemis db URI in an env file
- if you dont know what any of this means you have no reason to use this :)
  
```bash
npm run dev
```
