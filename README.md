Artemis frontend with an Aime switching ability because my lazy butt doesnt want to keep changing the text file manually

## Currently using
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- Drizzle
- Node
- Typescript
- Framer Motion
- Axios

## Todo
- Mobile layout if I actually get somewhere with this
- New Aime creation/profile adding
- Whole Chuni UI lol
- if you really want to run this be sure to use your local artemis db URI in an env file
- if you dont know what any of this means you have no reason to use this :)
  
```bash
npm run dev
```
